## Installations:
`NumPy`
`Pandas`
`Seaborn`
`Matplotlib`
`PySpark SQL`
`PySpark ML`

The use of any other software or tools beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebooks is not necessary.

## Project Motivation:
In this project, my aim was to predict customer churn for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming company. To accomplish this, the following tasks were undertaken:

- Dataset Preparation: Loading and cleaning a smaller subset (128MB) of the complete dataset (12GB).

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Conducting an in-depth analysis of the data to gain insights and determine which features are relevant for predicting churn.

- Feature Engineering: Creating new features that would be utilized in the modeling process.

- Modeling: Employing various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes, to build predictive models.

## File Descriptions:
Within the project, you will find the following files:

1. Exploratory Notebook:

- This notebook contains the code and analysis showcasing the process of predicting churn. Markdown cells are utilized throughout the notebook to provide explanations of the steps taken.

2. HTML File:

- An HTML version of the exploratory notebook is available for easy viewing and accessibility.

## Medium Blog Post:
For a more detailed explanation of the technical aspects of my project, you can refer to my Medium Blog post. It discusses the main findings and provides insights into the project. The selected model, the Random Forest Classifier, achieved an impressive F1 score.
